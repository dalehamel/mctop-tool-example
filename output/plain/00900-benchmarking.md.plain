TESTING MCTOP TOOL


Initial basic testing of the mctop and mcsnoop.bt tools were made easier
by printf to write commands to test tracing. At these lower call
frequencies though, errors such as were encountered are not immediately
obvious. It wasnâ€™t until memtier_benchmark was first used to generate
load was it completely clear what the cause of the garbled key reads
were.

Now that mctop has been cleaned up, and keys are stored properly this
tool can be used to demonstrate how mctop works, and show that it can
keep up with tracing requests to Memcached.


memtier benchmark

The memtier_benchmark tool can be used to generate load to the test
Memcached instance that I built earlier, with dtrace probes enabled.

Rather than having to print to nc, this allows for rapidly firing off a
large number of commands, showing that the tool is behaving as expected.
This also gives a lot more data, for more interesting exploration of the
tool, allowing for sorting on real data, and testing out dumping real
data to a JSON file.

A simple invocation of the tool:

    memtier_benchmark --server localhost --port 11211 -P memcache_text  --key-pattern=G:G

// FIXME dive into other options, show output in mctop
